# SportsStore
A full-stack sports store application where customers can buy sports products. Also an admin functionality is written with ASP.NET core Identity where the orders and products can be managed by a manager. It uses Razor and Blazor in the frontend, .NET core 3.1 and SQL server 2019 in the backend.

After you navigate to the project folder and run `docker-compose up`, you can see the products page like so:
